# SectionPy
Library with helpful geometric formulae, frequently used in structural analysis. 

Some of the functions operate on simple (non self intersecting) polygons. These functions take lists or arrays of vertex coordinate pairs.

- perimeter
- area
- centroid x and y
- moments of inertia
- radii of gyration
- extrema
- section modulii

#### Examples: Jupyter Notebook PDF
I am working on the development of this module using a Jupyter Notebook. I felt that printing a PDF would be helpful documentation for others to see it works. The actual Notebook is not posted, as it causes this repo to think that the primary langauge is not Python. More to come later.
